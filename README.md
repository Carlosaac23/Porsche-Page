## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Carlosaac23/Porsche-Page.git
   cd Porsche-Page
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (using Bun or npm)

   ```bash
   bun install
   # or
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   bun run dev
   # or
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the page live.  
   Edits auto-reload thanks to Vite!

## Why This Project Stands Out

- **Performance-first**: Fast dev feedback loops and optimized builds
- **Visual quality**: Crisp, modern design with responsive layouts
- **Type safety & scalability**: Clean TypeScript code ensures future growth
- **Deployment-ready**: Easy to expand and deploy via Vercel
